## 👋 Hello! Welcome to my Github profile.
### Hello, I am João Paulo, a passionate programmer for technology and always seeking to optimize and simplify solutions through code. I was born in Brasília and ### currently live in Natal, but always keep my passion for programming alive.

### I specialize in frontend, especially with React, Next and typescript, but also have advanced knowledge in Node, backend, unit tests, cleancode and others. In ### addition to technical skills, I am a communicative person, resilient and always seek to develop my personal and professional skills.

### Since April 2020, I have been working as a programmer and am always looking for new challenges and learning opportunities. It all started in 2016 when I had my ### first contacts with the C language, since then, I have been specializing and constantly seeking improvement.

### My experience and skills combined allow me to develop high-quality and efficient solutions.

### So... let's create something?
